Avoid_BG_fluctuation_TD2
===

This repository shows a way to assess the risk of fluctuating blood glucose levels in Diabetes Type 2 patients. For this repository synthetic data is used as existing patient data is highly sensible and must not be publicly available. For now simple classification algorithms are used which do not yield a satisfactory result yet.

For reproducing the workflow please run all the corresponding scripts. The file [Synthetic_Data](https://github.com/christophvoe/Avoid_BG_fluctuation_TD2/blob/main/Synthetic%20Data.Rmd) can't be reproduced as the existing patient data is not provided. To see the code in action follow the link to the [html document](https://github.com/christophvoe/Avoid_BG_fluctuation_TD2/blob/main/Synthetic-Data.html).
